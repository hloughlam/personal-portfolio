# Hajar Loughlam â€“ Personal Website

This is my personal website, built as part of a GUI assignment at UMass Lowell. 
It serves as a digital resume and creative portfolio to showcase my academic background, professional experience, personal projects, and volunteer work.

## About This Project

Even though this was a homework assignment, I put as much effort as possible because I want this to be something people look at in the future. 
I have had beginner experiences making websites, and I knew that if this assignment was to make a website, I might as well take it seriously. This was an incredible learning experience for me.

I created this site to:

- Practice HTML and CSS layout, structure, and styling
- Showcase my coursework, skills, and work experience
- Explore creative front-end features like Flexbox and hover effects. (I've used flexbox before, but only minimally)
- Finally commit to finishing a portfolio after several past attempts!
